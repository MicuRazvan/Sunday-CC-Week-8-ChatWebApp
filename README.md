# Week 8 Project â€” Chat Web App

## Context
I lost a bet with a friend and he challenged me that for the next 52 weeks, during weekends I need to create from scratch a new project.

For this week because of a busy schedule we decided on a quick app and went with weatherApp using an external API, and I will work on it only on saturday.

## The rules are the following:
*   Each Friday night, me and him will talk about what project I need to do.
*   Mostly he will decide for me, but Iâ€™m allowed to suggest and do my own ideas if he agrees on them.
*   Once the project is decided, he will tell me if Iâ€™m allowed to work Saturday and Sunday, or only Sunday.
(Surely this wonâ€™t backfire at some point by underestimating a project, right? ðŸ˜…)...well, it kinda did, didnt finish it in weekend.
