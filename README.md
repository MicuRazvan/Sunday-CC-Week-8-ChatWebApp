# Week 8 Project â€” Chat Web App

## Context
I lost a bet with a friend and he challenged me that for the next 52 weeks, during weekends I need to create from scratch a new project.

For this week we decided on an online chat app, and I will work on it only on saturday.

## The rules are the following:
*   Each Friday night, me and him will talk about what project I need to do.
*   Mostly he will decide for me, but Iâ€™m allowed to suggest and do my own ideas if he agrees on them.
*   Once the project is decided, he will tell me if Iâ€™m allowed to work Saturday and Sunday, or only Sunday.
(Surely this wonâ€™t backfire at some point by underestimating a project, right? ðŸ˜…)...well, it kinda did, didnt finish it in weekend.

## About the project & Features

* I used Spring boot as the main web framework with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Thymeleaf.
* The main page allows the user to create new chats and all of his active chats are shown on the bottom of the page minimized, clicking them will open the UI for that chat.
* The chat UI shows all the members, the messages and who sent them, the bar that allows users to send new messages and buttons to leave or add extra members.
